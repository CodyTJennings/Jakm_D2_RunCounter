# Found Item

Clicking "Found Item" will prompt a pop up for the item name that will stop the current run and add the item to the list with the associated run number

By checking "Grail Only", it only attempts to add the item to your grail, but doesnt add to the runs list of items

# Save/Load

You can save the current run session statistics to your local computer as a CSV file, which can then be imported any time to resume the session

# Holy Grail

You can track your progress of the items you've found as well as the date you found them. When you click "Found Item" in a run, it will automatically check your profile's database to see if you have found the item and if not, add it to your collection.

If you're not in a run, you can add an item to your holy grail with "Add to Grail" (Also accessbile from the overlay)

You can filter the list of all items by Found, Not Found, by Catagory (Unique, Set, Runewords, Runes) or search the item

You will be prompted to create a profile when first launching the app. The profile will keep track of your Holy Grail statistics and you can create multiple (Ladder/Non-Ladder etc..)
